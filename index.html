          This project explores the history and present circumstances of freelancers in the Scottish screen sector. The data to support this analysis comes from a historical source; the Film Bang directory, and interviews and surveys conducted over summer 2020. The research makes policy recommendations for growth, innovation and recovery for the sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freelancers in the Scottish screen sector have been instrumental in the growth of a nascent <b>cluster</b> in Scotland. They produced a skilled and flexible source of labour, a provision that has been consistent despite ebbs and flows of demand.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
      <p>
        Freelancers continue to provide a vital part of the ecosystem of the screen sector. We see them as key because on the one hand <b>freelancing is a core access route into the industry</b>. On the other, the screen industry and the business models the broadcasting industry uses are <b>dependent</b> on the ability to draw on both employed and freelance staff. Supporting the freelance screen workforce is fundamental for the growth and ongoing resilience of regional screen sectors.

          Historically, the Scottish screen sector freelance community was instrumental in the early growth of this regional creative hub.
          <br><br>
          However, job uncertainty and vulnerability for freelancers are challenges that have been built into the way in which the industry is structured for several decades.
          <br><br>
          In order for the hub to recover and grow it is essential that the issues that produce the barriers and challenges faced by freelancers in this sector be addressed by policy makers, the industry as a whole, and by the freelance workforce themselves.

        <p>The Covid-19 lockdowns have revealed structural problems for the sustainability of freelancers across the creative industries.</p>
        <p>
        As of spring 2021 productions have already returned, and freelancers feel an understandable urgency to fill those roles and get back to work. The risk inherent in a rush back into production is that lessons will not be learned and the urgent need for work will mask the need to address and improve working conditions.

        In 1976 the Film Bang directory was launched as a manifesto calling for investment in the indigenous Scottish screen industry. Significant successes followed for both feature film and television production with sustained growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

                      The impetus behind the launch of Film Bang in 1976 came from a tight-knit group of freelance members of the ACTT union. Over the next few years their aspirations for an indigenous film industry were realised with the development of a proto-type screen industry creative cluster for Scotland with feature film and television production supported by inward investment such as by Channel 4 and Goldcrest Films. Key productions include feature films Gregory’s Girl (1981), Local Hero (1983), and many television programmes such as Brond (1987), Blood Red Roses (1986).

        Barriers to entry such as job and income insecurity are particularly difficult for new entrants from lower socio-economic groups and are a major hurdle for industry aspirations to increase diversity and widen access

        <p>
          Freelancers in film and television face specific, complex challenges that are different to those faced by freelancers in the creative industries in general. The particular circumstances for this sector of the creative industries should be recognised. Our conclusions expose structural concerns which are illustrated by our qualitative findings (descriptions of intense challenges) and backed up by quantitative data (high levels of attrition). These boil down to:
          <ul>
            <li>  -	<b>Dependency</b> of the sector on freelancers, with a history of employers taking little responsibility for ongoing support.</li>
            <li>  -	Freelancers left to take <b>responsibility for</b>: the existence of the freelance pool, skills development, mobility, training in new technology.</li>

          Government, industry and other stakeholders </b>should consult to develop regulations and protections to offset the barriers and challenges to sustaining freelance careers in the screen sector. There should be analysis of how the current system left the workforce vulnerable (highlighted and exacerbated by COVID-19 and the accusation of the UK Government failures to support creative freelancers). This is about improving working conditions. It is also about recognising and mediating

      <p>
        It is also about <b>recognising and mediating
        risks</b>, rewards and responsibilities being negotiated between employers and the freelance workforce on which they depend. Checks and balances need to be in place. Critically, the imbalances demonstrated in our findings are also an underlying cause of the lack of diversity in the sector.
        Transparency and accountability are two principles that can guide work in this area.

      <h2>Institutional Infrastructure</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column">
        <p>
          Screen Scotland, the BFI, BECTU and Screen Skills already provide support for freelancers. This infrastructure is engaged in  lobbying, training, funding, mediating. A focus for intervention here would be for these bodies to take account of the responsibilities at stake and work to distribute these rather than focusing them on freelancers.
          <br><br>
          We would advocate developing ways to make training and skills development a sector wide responsibility.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          Building on this existing institutional ecosystem, we propose investigating
           contemporary models of (creative) clusters: incubator hubs and start-up communities; and how these can be adapted to offer a useful model for the screen sector.
           There are good Scottish examples in the technology and creative sectors such as Codebase in Edinburgh (and beyond) and The Whisky Bond in Glasgow who incorporate training, mentoring and skills development in their model while simplifying the material requirements of business development. Translating and adapting these models over to the screen sector represents a progressive opportunity.  The advent of a studio or studios in Scotland provides a prime opportunity to look at developing the above scheme/structure.

<!-- industry Action -->

<section>
  <div class="wrap">
      <h2>Industry Action</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column">
        <p>
          The business model for the broadcasters and production companies relies upon having a pool of freelance labour to draw on during production. This is true at all levels of production.
          The conclusion from this interdependency is that the responsibility for finding ways to improve resilience and sustainability should lie with the entire sector. The industry itself has an important role to play in addressing:
          <p>
            - Hiring practices<br>
            - Supporting networks<br>
            - Investing in the skills development of a shared labour pool<br>
            - Dramatically improving working practices<br>
            - Enabling and supporting progression and advancement
          </p>

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          Training on the job for example shares the onus for training between production and freelancers and ensures the training is fit for purpose. This is also about making connections between more experienced workers (giving the training) and those at a different stage in their development: circumstantial networking and mentoring is built into a training scheme, again shifting the weight off the individual.
          <br>
          <br>
          The argument for <b>transparent recruitment</b>  practices comes up in the literature and in our survey responses. Transparent recruitment is not just about focusing on entry level roles. Everyone has to benefit from this change if it is to be taken up. So, again, it should apply to all levels of career progression.
