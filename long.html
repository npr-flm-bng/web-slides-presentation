                  <p><b>This project</b> examines the freelance workforce in the Scottish screen sector.
                      It makes a historical case study of the Film Bang directory of freelancers in Scotland in order to assess the barriers and challenges from the bottom-up, presenting evidence from the experiences of individual members of this workforce.

                    <br>
                    It argues that a nascent cluster of freelancers were vital to the establishment of a regional hub for film and television production. This is just one of many creative clusters in regions outside London and the south east of England.

                    Film Bang was first launched as a printed directory in 1976 and for the past 45 years these publications, and since 2008 the associated website, have provided a resource for freelance production personnel and technicians and for employers in the Scottish screen industries.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using the data published between 1976-2020 we track the development of the Scottish ‘community of practice’, a creative cluster that has evolved for over four decades.

            The findings begin to identify the challenges that need to be considered by Government and the industry in order to widen access, promote diversity and support progression and survival for successful, long-term freelance careers in film and television. Some issues, for example a shortage of studio facilities, are specific to the Scottish situation, but the findings are also relevant to supporting the growth of regional screen clusters in other parts of the UK.

          Our qualitative research was carried out during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic March – September 2020.  Survey and interview responses give a clear indication of the strain freelancers have experienced under the various lockdowns, comparatively unsupported by UK Government schemes. While these circumstances might be viewed as exceptional our findings indicate that many of the break points or underlying problems for freelancers in the sector have been exposed as structural.

            In 1976 the Film Bang directory was launched as a manifesto calling for investment in the indigenous Scottish screen industry. Significant successes followed for both feature film and television production with sustained growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

              This study is the first time that longitudinal evidence has been gathered to analyse the Scottish screen sector.</b> There have been UK national surveys of freelancers such as the Creative Skillset Audit (biennially from 2003-2015) and the BFI Tracking Project (1999) and the BFI Statistical Yearbooks, however it is acknowledged that “there is very limited reliable and consistent data on the sector, its value and trends in Scotland.”  (Creative Scotland, 2017).

              In this sub-sector freelance roles exist because of the need for a contingent supply of labour, a readily accessible skilled workforce, available at short notice to work on intense periods of film and television production activity. In Scotland anchor organisations such as BBC Scotland and Scottish Television have always relied upon a freelance workforce, in addition to the technicians employed as staff, in order to have the flexible capacity to adjust to fluctuating demand for production. The current business model for broadcasters and the independent production companies depends on this cohort of production and technical personnel, engaged to work on short fixed-term contracts but only during periods of production which are often seasonal.

            In order to understand what kind of agency freelancers have with regard to their work we have to take account of the specificity of the film sector working practices. Previous research has questioned the degree of autonomy and choice self-employed and freelance workers genuinely have, pointing too to the increased risks of financial insecurity, isolation and exploitative working conditions driven by the structure and organisation of work in parts of the sector (Alacovska, 2018; ArtsPay, 2018; Butler and Russell, 2018; GoodCorporation 2016); (Giles, Spilsbury & Carey, 2020:10).

              Individual freelancers provide services that contribute to the collaborative process of production for film and television, thus unlike some other sectors of the Creative Industries, it is not possible for these freelancers to market these services outside the structure of the screen industry.

            Job roles across the sector differ enormously depending on the specialist role and length of career. Once fully established, self-employed freelance heads of department demonstrate a wide range of proven skills and experience and will have acquired the track record, reputation, and contacts necessary to secure work in an industry where recruitment is often by word of mouth and rarely open and transparent. However, new entrants and those in the early stages of their career face very difficult challenges as they seek to gain experience and skills which are exacerbated by the uncertainty of employment and low wages.
<br>
<br>
            Our qualitative evidence reveals that even for experienced freelancers there are intense pressures as a result of job insecurity.

        The structure of the freelance workforce in the film and television sector is based upon the historic legacy of a highly regulated, unionised framework. Many freelance job roles for technicians and production crew in film and television have specific areas of responsibility, whilst these roles contribute to the overall creative achievement of the productions the individual freelancers do not have control to self-determine their input or over their pattern of work.
        <br><br>
        <b>
        This is a type of self-employed freelance role is very distinct from the entrepreneurial self-determined artist or designer roles which fall under the Creative Industries banner.

      The fundamental crux of freelance work concerns individual agency. From the comments in our survey, rather than simply supporting the need for skills and talent development there is a need to tackle job insecurity and working conditions which are the issues that make freelancers feel most vulnerable and force people to leave this sector.

                          <p>
                              The impetus behind the launch of Film Bang in 1976 came from a tight-knit group of freelance members of the ACTT union. Over the next few years their aspirations for an indigenous film industry were realised with the development of a proto-type screen industry creative cluster for Scotland with feature film and television production supported by inward investment such as by Channel 4 and Goldcrest Films. Key productions include feature films Gregory’s Girl (1981), Local Hero (1983), and many television programmes such as Brond (1987), Blood Red Roses (1986).

                            The 1990s marked a period of continuing and accelerating growth of the freelance workforce. The 1990 Broadcasting Act required an increased quota of independently produced programmes not just for Channel 4 but also for the BBC and ITV and local independent production companies.
                            Production of major feature films in Scotland continued and used local crews including Shallow Grave (1991), Rob Roy (1995), Trainspotting (1996).
                            There were new, more flexible working arrangements with the demise of the closed-shop union for the industry and many of the previous barriers to entry ceased to operate.

                            The 2003 Communication Act led to the transformation of the ITV system. STV, the Scottish ITV franchise-holder,  overstretched and vulnerable, lost key returning network commissions such as Taggart and High Road that had previously provided regular work for freelancers.
                            At the same time there were fewer feature films being made in Scotland and the national agency, Scottish Screen, went through a period of instability.
                            Recognition of this decline led  the Scottish Government to establish the Scottish Broadcasting Commission in 2007 with a remit to investigate how to improve levels of production and assess the importance of the screen sector to the Scottish economy.

                            Since 2010 the workforce registered with Film Bang has levelled at around 650. This reflects a gradual restoration of production and some significant high-budget incoming productions such as the Outlander series (2014-present) made by Left Bank Productions and Sony Pictures for the US Starz network, and The Outlaw King (2018) made by Sigma Films for Netflix. However as noted earlier, other sources, such as the ONS, point to higher growth for the sector during this period, with the impact of freelance crew networking and sharing contact information via social media groups on Facebook and other platforms, the Film Bang directory is no longer a comprehensive record of the Scottish freelance community.

        It is acknowledged by the industry that it is hard to get started working in the screen sector (Carey, Crowley, Dudley, Sheldon and Giles, 2017). It is highly competitive and there are systemic barriers making it hard for all new entrants but in particular women, ethnic minorities and those with disabilities. The structure of the workforce and the variety and range of departments and job roles is not common knowledge and many areas have specialised hierarchies.
        <br><br>
        To make these jobs more attractive there needs to be <b>greater transparency</b> for potential recruits as to how the industry is structured, the varied range of different roles and information about the career pathways.

          Knowledge and information barriers</b> were highlighted by our survey respondents citing that a key challenge is “Finding work when positions aren’t advertised”, and that to get work “You need to know someone, which is not good working practice.”(Appendix # main challenges). Several argued that that there should be “More transparent hiring. Navigating the person to person network from outside of Glasgow is next to impossible.” (Appendix # policy interventions). This lack of access to networks means entry level jobs (indeed all levels of jobs) can be opaque.

        "... work experience is almost essential to gain entry to employment in the sector. The average worker within film must undertake 46 days of unpaid work experience before gaining their first “official” position, and across the whole creative sectors, new entrants work unpaid on average for 52 days before gaining a paid position. Undergoing two and half months of unpaid work is a mammoth task for anyone without private financial backing, and poses a significant barrier to entry into the screen industry."(Carey, Crowley, Dudley & Giles, 2017: 11)

                    Recruitment is through narrow channels, and frequently based on social connections (nepotism) amounting to a closed shop so newcomers are most vulnerable at a point in their careers where job uncertainty is greatest and unpaid internships are dominant. (Carey, Crowley, Dudley & Giles, 2017 p15) We see a very high level of attrition with new entrants failing to get established and so leaving the industry.

          “While the creative Industries and creative economy are now recognised as a policy priority; and many consider the sector to offer high value activities, highly paid, high-skilled roles, this is not the full reality. Much of the work is often low-paid and precarious, jeopardising the health and wellbeing of the workforce, and there are significant concerns about how improvements are hampered by management and leadership capability and poor working practices”.

      The most common cited challenge was to do with finding work. Job insecurity, low pay for junior roles, and the complexity of HMRC regulations regarding self-employed status were all highlighted as issues across large numbers of respondents.
<br><br>
The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the problems caused by various types of ‘freelance’ identities: from sole traders, to micro-businesses (including personal service limited companies), to individuals recognised by HRMC for tax purposes as PAYE Schedule D self-employed.
<br><br>
Many bodies lobbying for freelancers have argued that this patchwork of regulations has resulted in this section of the workforce failing to receive an adequate level of support from Government for the disruption caused by lockdown during the pandemic compared to other parts of the economy.

      <h2>Caring Responsibilities:</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column">
        <p>
Numerous survey responses pointed to how freelance working in the screen sector is currently incompatible with caring responsibilities. The challenge of returning to freelance work after a career-break was also seen as unsurmountable. This leads to a talent drain with many people with skills and experience effectively unable to continue or return.
<br><br>
Added to which “...the insecurity and often temporary nature of labour within the creative industries disproportionately affect women (as well as people from other disadvantaged social groups). A number of intersecting factors contribute to this imbalance but, in the case of women, derives from the ‘automatic connection’ between women and childcare in which it is taken for granted that parenting is primarily women’s responsibility.” (Spicer & Presence, 2017: p51)

                <p>
                    The listings reveal that despite the high rate of attrition there are a significant number of freelancers remaining in the directory for 7 years or more 29% (1035). With 10% (357) entries who have careers longer than 15 years, and 6% (207) of the total entries are listed for over 20 years. These longer careers are essential for sustained growth in a regional screen cluster. In the short-term increased production capacity can be created with freelancers moving to work on short-term contracts away from home, bring crew from other parts of the UK to work on productions in Scotland. This has always been a part of the way in which the film and television industry has worked for location filming.

                  Long-term dependency upon incoming crew inhibits growth and prevents a regional cluster from nurturing the pool of talent required to support on-going expansion. Although the numbers are relatively small the fact that Film Bang reveals that Scottish freelancers have sustained these lasting careers is significant. In order to allow this expansion to continue (or start up once more) it will be essential to support those in mid-career and find ways to keep this skilled workforce in the local industry and support them so they do not either move away permanently or leave the sector.
                  <br><br>
                  Freelancers in this sector clearly have a good sense of how the industry operates, understand its structures, because they need to know how to move through its structures to have any chance of sustaining a career.

        <div class="column">
        <p>
          <b>Career Strategies:</b>
          Our survey and interview responses make it evident that longevity of career requires determination and resilience with a personal commitment to remaining in the industry. As a freelancer it is essential to maintain a network of contacts, but not to be completely dependent upon working in a single team. Survival is not possible without an excellent professional work ethic and flexibility.

        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Working hard and maintaining a good relationship with people I work with.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Being open to work at any budget level. Being prepared to work hard, be uncomfortable, hungry, tired, and trying to remain cheerful whilst doing so. Abandoning all notions of a regular life outside work”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
      <p>
        <b>Mobility:</b>
        Although most crew in Film Bang are seeking work locally, nevertheless some of the personnel listed are based in Scotland but spend most of their time working in other parts of the UK and overseas. The qualitative evidence reveals this is especially true for senior creative roles across both production, editorial and technical departments. Being mobile and able to work outside Scotland is an essential strategy for those heads of department to progress to higher quality, higher budget productions, as confirmed in our interviews.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Being prepared to move around to facilitate work“
        </p>
        <p>
          “Extreme flexibility regarding location of work. Maintaining good contacts across the industry.
          Being good at my job.”

                    Financial planning and developing skills in money management was seen as essential and an area where the workforce could benefit from ongoing training and support. A number of interviewees raised the idea that they expected that their freelance career would necessarily only be for a short-term duration and that they expected to move on, “settling down” in their thirties, foresaw they would need a less uncertain work life with regular hours and better working conditions. Others who had sustained long careers talked about the challenge of finding a suitable exit strategy and pivoting to a different career.

          Freelancers in the Scottish (regional) sector have been instrumental in the growth of a nascent cluster. They produced a skilled and flexible source of labour, a provision that has been consistent despite ebbs and flows of demand. Our longitudinal research confirms it has been possible for around 30% of those in this cohort to sustain careers lasting over 7 years.

        Freelancers continue to provide a vital part of the ecosystem of the screen sector. We see them as key because on the one hand freelancing is a core access route into the industry. On the other, the screen industry and the business models the broadcasting industry uses are dependent on the ability to draw on both employed and freelance staff. Supporting the freelance screen workforce is fundamental for the growth and ongoing resilience of regional screen sectors.

      The Covid-19 lockdown revealed structural problems for the sustainability of freelancers across the creative industries.
<br><br>
      job uncertainty and vulnerability for the freelancers in the Scottish screen sector have been built into the way in which the industry is structured for several decades. <br>
This freelance community was a catalyst for the early growth of this regional creative hub, in order for the hub to recover and grow it is essential that the issues that lead to the barriers and challenges be addressed by policy makers, the industry as a whole, and by the freelance workforce themselves.

    Productions have already returned, and freelancers feel an understandable urgency to fill those roles and get back to work. The risk inherent in a rush back into production is that lessons will not be learned and the urgent need for work will mask the need to address and improve working conditions.

          Government, industry and other stakeholders </b>should consult to develop regulations and protections to offset the barriers and challenges to sustaining freelance careers in the screen sector. There should be analysis of how the current system left the workforce vulnerable (highlighted and exacerbated by COVID-19 and the accusation of the UK Government failures to support creative freelancers). This is about improving working conditions. It is also about recognising and mediating

        It is also about <b>recognising and mediating
        risks</b>, rewards and responsibilities being negotiated between employers and the freelance workforce on which they depend. Checks and balances need to be in place. Critically, the imbalances demonstrated in our findings are also an underlying cause of the lack of diversity in the sector.
        Transparency and accountability are two principles that can guide work in this area.

      <h2>Institutional Infrastructure</h2>

        <div class="column">
        <p>
          There are already stakeholders in the sector who seek to provide support for freelancers, such as Screen Scotland, the BFI, BECTU and Screen Skills. This infrastructure is engaged in multiple overlapping ways; lobbying, training, funding, mediating. If we see a focus for intervention here it is that these bodies take account of the responsibilities at stake and work to distribute these rather than focusing them on freelancers.  For example, regarding training this tends to be offered directly to freelancers to self-fund in order to develop their portfolio of skills. We would advocate developing ways to make training and skills development a sector wide responsibility.

      <div class="column">
      <p>
        Extrapolating from this existing institutional ecosystem, we propose investigating whether more contemporary models of (creative) clusters: incubator hubs and start-up communities can be adapted to offer a useful model. Finding the balance between flexibility and growth is difficult but there are good Scottish examples in the technology and creative sectors such as Codebase in Edinburgh (and beyond) and The Whisky Bond in Glasgow who incorporate training, mentoring and skills development in their model while simplifying the material requirements of business development. Translating and adapting these models over to the screen sector represents a progressive opportunity.  The advent of a studio or studios in Scotland provides a prime opportunity to look at developing the above scheme/structure.

      <h2>Industry Action</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="column">
        <p>
          The business model for the broadcasters and production companies relies upon having a pool of freelance labour to draw on during production. This is true at all levels of production from small single television programme commissions, to recurring network series, to high-end drama and feature films. The conclusion from this interdependency is that the responsibility for finding ways to improve resilience and sustainability should lie with the entire sector. The industry itself has an important role to play in addressing:
          <ul>
            <li>- hiring practices</li>
            <li>- supporting networks</li>
            <li>-  investing in the skills development of a shared labour pool</li>
            <li>- dramatically improving working practices, example those with caring responsibilities</li>
            <li>- enabling and supporting progression and advancement</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
      <p>
        Training on the job for example shares the onus for training between production and freelancers and ensures the training is fit for purpose. This is also about making connections between more experienced workers (giving the training) and those at a different stage in their development: circumstantial networking and mentoring is built into a training scheme, again shifting the weight off the individual.
<br><br>
        The argument for transparent recruitment practices comes up in the literature and in our survey responses. Transparent recruitment is not just about focusing on entry level roles. Everyone has to benefit from this change if it is to be taken up. So, again, it should apply to all levels of career progression.
